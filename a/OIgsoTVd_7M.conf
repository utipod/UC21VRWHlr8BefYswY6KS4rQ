description = "Digital technologies create new opportunities, but also challenges for collaboration between the public and private sectors and civil society. In the first of three panels looking at how multistakeholder initiatives and the new digital landscape interact, activists, policymakers, NGOs and business discuss how multi-actor approaches to complex problems can leverage technology to support sustainability and â€˜building back betterâ€™ after the pandemic.\n\nThe discussion will explore questions such as: Who is defining and driving new policy, norms and practices around the use of technology?
